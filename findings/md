# Findings — Bitcoin Performance & Volatility Analysis (2010–2024)

This project examines 5,059 days of Bitcoin price activity from July 27, 2010 to May 22, 2024, focusing on how Bitcoin behaves as a financial asset over different time horizons.

Rather than emphasizing headlines or dramatic price swings, this analysis uses intraday returns (open → close) to evaluate Bitcoin’s performance and volatility in a way that aligns with traditional financial analytics.

## 1. Daily Perspective — Bitcoin Is Extremely Volatile

The SQL results show that Bitcoin’s best and worst days were:

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Best single day | **2013-11-18 — +41.68% intraday return** |
| Worst single day | **2020-03-12 — −40.44% intraday return** |

Interpretation:

- Bitcoin has experienced dramatic price spikes and crashes within a single trading day.
- These extreme events often align with major macroeconomic factors:
  - November 2013 → speculative surge during the first significant Bitcoin boom
  - March 2020 → broad COVID-19 panic when global financial markets sold off simultaneously

This supports a traditional financial conclusion:  
> Bitcoin exhibits extremely high short-term volatility and is risky for short-horizon trading.

## 2. Monthly Perspective — Volatility Smooths Out Over Time

Aggregating daily intraday returns into monthly averages produces a different view:

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Best month | **2013-11 — +6.12% average intraday return** |
| Worst month | **2022-06 — −1.43% average intraday return** |

Interpretation:

- Even in its strongest month, Bitcoin’s average intraday return was only 6.12%.
- Even in its weakest month, the average intraday return was −1.43%.

This suggests:

> Although Bitcoin is highly volatile from day to day, when viewed month-to-month, the extreme movements flatten and produce far more modest average returns.

## 3. Early Data Behavior (2010–2012)

The dataset shows that the earliest portion of Bitcoin trading history contains many days where:

open_price = high_price = low_price = close_price

As a result:

- Daily return = 0%**
- Average monthly return = 0%
- Monthly volatility = 0%

This does not indicate a problem in the SQL calculations.  
It reflects characteristics of the early Bitcoin market:

- Low liquidity
- Sparse price reporting
- Minimal recorded intraday variation

Because of this, volatility patterns are most meaningful beginning in later years when intraday price movement is consistently present.

## 4. What This Means from an Investment-Time-Horizon View

The data supports a balanced conclusion familiar to traditional asset analysis:

| Timeframe | Bitcoin Behavior |
|----------|------------------|
| **Day-to-day** | Extremely volatile — sharp intraday swings, major spikes and crashes |
| **Month-to-month** | Net returns are generally modest; volatility smooths out |
| **Long-term cycles** | Broad expansions and contractions similar to cyclical financial assets |

A practical interpretation is:

> Bitcoin behaves like a highly volatile asset in the short term, but over longer horizons its average performance becomes much less dramatic and is driven by macroeconomic cycles rather than random chaos.

This perspective does not claim that Bitcoin is “safe” or “stable.”  
It simply reflects what the data shows:

- **Short-term trading amplifies volatility**  
- **Long-term holding smooths volatility and reveals cyclical trends**

## 5. Limitations & Opportunities for Future Work

This project focuses only on **intraday return (open → close)**.  
Other valid approaches could extend the analysis, including:

- Day-over-day return based on closing prices using window functions
- Sharpe ratio / risk-adjusted performance
- Comparisons with equity indices (S&P 500, NASDAQ)
- Event-based volatility windows around major financial news

---

## Summary

This project demonstrates the following:

- Ability to load and analyze a large real-world financial dataset using SQL
- Use of calculated fields, aggregation, date functions, and volatility metrics
- Communication of findings with cautious financial interpretation rather than hype
- Recognition that different time horizons reveal different risk profiles

In plain terms:

> Bitcoin may look chaotic day-to-day, but across longer spans it behaves more like a cyclical financial asset whose returns and volatility are driven by macroeconomic forces.

This conclusion is supported directly by SQL results — not by market sentiment or speculation.
